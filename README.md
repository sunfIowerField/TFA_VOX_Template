INFORMATION SECTION (Located in the Lua as well)
1. If your making a VOX pack with this please credit me in the Description. You don't have to add me as a contributor.
2. If your files are a different filetype change vo/scales/Death_1.ogg to vo/scales/Death_1.wav for example.
3. If you make multiple VOXes with this template make sure to make folders and change the code i.e add a folder, put your sounds in, and change the Lua here. For example, vo/scales/Death_1.ogg becomes vo/scales/(packname)/Death_1.ogg.
4. If you need a good resource for Voicelines, here are some: https://www.youtube.com/c/ForceVO/videos, https://mega.nz/folder/HrRVjCyI#dEg16A9xPRFM9jsQAVMIhg
5. If you want to add more Voicelines than just one, just add more to the soundtable. Example { "vo/scales/NoAmmo_1.ogg"} ) becomes { "vo/scales/NoAmmo_1.ogg", "vo/scales/NoAmmo_2.ogg", "vo/scales/NoAmmo_3.ogg" } ) and so on. Copy and Paste is your best friend here.
